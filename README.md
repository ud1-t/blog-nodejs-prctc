# Node.js Blog Practice Project

This is a practice project I created while learning Node.js. It utilizes various technologies including Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, and follows the MVC architecture pattern. The project also integrates the Morgan middleware for logging.

- **Create:** Users can create new blog posts.
- **List:** Blog posts are listed on the website.
- **Delete:** Users can delete existing blog posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **EJS:** Embedded JavaScript templating.
- **Morgan:** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
